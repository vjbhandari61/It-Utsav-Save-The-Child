            Conflict is one of the leading causes of hunger and poverty and a fact of life in many of the communities where Concern works
        </h1>
        <P>It’s often a deciding factor when we enter a new country, creating large humanitarian needs especially around hunger and poverty. Last year, Concern began to respond to these needs in Ukraine. In 2021, similar circumstances led to us establishing programmes in Burkina Faso. Here are the stories behind those — and 12 other countries in conflict where we are currently at work. </P>
     <p>Despite development advances in recent years, Afghanistan remains an extremely volatile and fragile country following nearly four decades of instability. Violence continues to undermine the country’s development, with almost two thirds of the Afghan population living in areas directly affected by conflict. Between 2009 and 2022, the Council on Foreign Relations estimates that there were 111,000 civilian casualties in Afghanistan. 

        This has a direct impact on humanitarian aid. Before the US military withdrew from the country in 2021, over 18 million people required humanitarian assistance — including over 3 million children. This was double the number of people who required assistance compared to January 2020. Today, UNOCHA estimates that 28.3 million people require humanitarian assistance. </p>
    <p>More than 45 years of conflict in Afghanistan have gradually worn down the coping mechanisms and resilience of millions — and that was before August 2021. During the Taliban De-Facto Authorities government transition, Concern warned of an impending humanitarian catastrophe, with then-Concern Worldwide CEO Dominic MacSorley saying: “Even before the recent unprecedented change in context across the country, 18.4 million people were depending on humanitarian assistance.” Since then, many governments and international NGOs have suspended aid to the country. 

      At the same time, humanitarian need has increased by nearly 29%, with 23.7 million Afghans requiring humanitarian assistance. As UNOCHA reports in its 2024 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan for Afghanistan: “The effects of political transition, economic contraction, and diminished development assistance have amplified protection risks and humanitarian needs.” The situation became even more dire at the end of last year, when the Pakistani government set into motion plans to repatriate over 1 million Afghan refugees. </p>

 <p>A decade of armed conflict in the western Sahel region of Africa has resulted in a deteriorating humanitarian situation across Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. Crisis knows no borders, and what began as violence in Mali in January of 2012 has now resulted in attacks across the region, which surged in 2021. That year alone, UNOCHA estimates that half a million people were displaced. </p>
     <p>Currently, UNOCHA estimates 4.7 million people in the Sahel require humanitarian aid — a 34% increase compared to last year. UNICEF estimates 3.2 million children require assistance — a 23% increase compared to last year. Despite going on for over a decade, the violence has escalated in recent years due to broken ceasefires and renewed hostilities.</p>
<p>A landlocked country in western Africa that’s home to 21.5 million, Burkina Faso is the site of a growing crisis that has gone largely underreported in our media.

  Political marginalisation, the effects of the climate crisis, and conflict have combined to form an unprecedented humanitarian emergency in a country that, until recently, was most concerned with chronic hunger and malnutrition. This is also one of the reasons that Concern began working in Burkina Faso at the beginning of 2021. 
  
  What led to conditions becoming so severe? Read on for five key points about Burkina Faso’s humanitarian crisis - and to learn about how Concern is working with communities to offset the scope and impact of this humanitarian emergency. </p>

<p>Since November 2020, conflict in northern Ethiopia has led to a growing humanitarian crisis. As of early 2023, 3.1 million people across the country are internally displaced — down from a peak of 5.1 million in 2021. 

  While a peace deal was signed in November 2022, the net effects of the conflict continue. Hunger has been one of the major concerns, with the scale and level of food insecurity soaring in recent years. In 2023, the UN estimates that 9 million people  are in need of food assistance.</p>
 <p>In 2022, Ethiopia experienced multiple humanitarian crises that endangered the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. An on-going drought, which began in 2020, has severely impacted pastoralist communities in the Eastern and Southern regions of Ethiopia. As a consequence, an estimated 13 million people are suffering food insecurity, malnutrition, limited access to water, and increased risk of disease. In the Oromia and Somali regions, people are simultaneously affected by both drought and conflict. Although a cessation of hostilities has been achieved in Northern Ethiopia, significant humanitarian needs arising from conflict still persist. There remains an estimated 2.6 million internally displaced persons in Northern Ethiopia alone.</p>   <p>Why are we in Ethiopia? Ethiopia is a country particularly vulnerable to weather-related shocks, such as droughts and floods, with over 80% of the rural population dependent on rain-fed agriculture. Four consecutive failed rain seasons have had a devastating effect on parts of the country, with over 4.5 million livestock deaths since late 2021. Ethiopia faces the added challenge of hosting 941,000 refugees from other countries, as well as recovering from intense conflict in the northern regions, with millions left internally displaced.</p>

Between 2009 and 2022, the Council on Foreign Relations estimates that there were 111,000 civilian casualties in Afghanistan.

   <p>The beginning of the ongoing Somali Civil War is a subject of debate. Many organisations (including the UN) say it was 1991. Other experts argue that it started as many as 10 years earlier. This gives you an idea of how long the country has faced violence and insecurity, regardless of how it’s been labelled. 

    Despite a number of ongoing crises in Somalia, the violence and brutality of conflict is the crisis that arches over all the others. Civilian casualties due to violence aren’t the biggest killer, however. Three decades of instability have weakened the country’s health system and undermined other key aspects of its infrastructure. These issues have increased due to the current drought crisis across the Horn of Africa. In Somalia, all of this has left 7.8 million people in need of humanitarian aid — over 5 million of whom are children. Huge portions of the country are not under government control. 
    
    As Concern Somalia’s country director, Abdi Rashid Haji-Nur, explains: “Operationally, it is difficult for national and international humanitarian agencies to deliver services to people in the different parts of the country. As long as there is absence of efforts to contain and to deescalate those tensions and conflicts, we will be having challenges in terms of having access.”</p>
