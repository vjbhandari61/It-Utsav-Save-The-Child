        <h1>An entire generation of children in Sudan faces a catastrophe as the war enters its second year.</h1>
     <p>PORT SUDAN, 14 April 2024 – One year since violence exploded in Sudan, and as the ensuing crisis continues to deepen, the lives, educations and futures of a generation of Sudanese children hang in the balance.

        Beyond the direct impact of the violence on children, the ongoing war has fueled a lethal combination of displacement, disease outbreaks and hunger. Almost 4 million children under five are projected to suffer from acute malnutrition this year, including 730,000 projected to suffer from life-threatening severe acute malnutrition. Sudan now has one of the worst education crises in the world, with more than 90 per cent of the country's 19 million school-age children having no access to formal education. The ongoing disruption to education will result in a generational crisis for Sudan. </p>
    <p>“This brutal war and potential famine is creating an ominous environment for a catastrophic loss of children’s lives,” said UNICEF Deputy Executive Director, Ted Chaiban. “Almost half of the children suffering from severe acute malnutrition are in areas that are hard to access, where there is ongoing fighting, making their conditions all the more dire. This is all avoidable, and we can save lives if all parties to the conflict allow us to access communities in need and to fulfil our humanitarian mandate – without politicizing aid.”

       </p><p> Hunger and malnutrition make children much more vulnerable to disease and death. With vaccination coverage dropping significantly due to the fighting, hundreds of thousands of children lacking access to safe drinking water, and significant access issues due to the violence, ongoing disease outbreaks such as cholera, measles, malaria, and dengue threaten the lives of hundreds of thousands of children. Spikes in mortality, especially among internally displaced children, are a forewarning of a possible huge loss of life, as the country enters the annual lean season.

      </p><p>  Ensuring predictable and sustainable access to vulnerable populations is critical to preventing catastrophic hunger and famine. Meanwhile, basic systems and social services in Sudan are on the brink of collapse, with frontline workers not being paid for a year, vital supplies depleted, and infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, still under attack. Children and families’ access to health, nutrition, water, and sanitation hangs by a thread, further compounding the crisis.</p>

            UN estimates 17,000 Gaza children left unaccompanied amid Israel’s war.
        </h1>
        <p>“Each [child] has a heartbreaking story of loss and grief,” said Jonathan Crickx, UNICEF’s chief of communication for the occupied Palestinian territories.

            “This [17,000] figure corresponds to 1 percent of the overall displaced population – 1.7 million people,” he told a media briefing via video-link from Jerusalem, saying the number was an estimation as it is near impossible to verify information under current conditions.
            
            Each one “is a child who is coming to terms with a horrible new reality”, he added.</p>
            <p>Crickx said that tracing who the unaccompanied children were was proving “extremely difficult”, as they were sometimes brought to a hospital wounded or in shock, and “they simply can’t even say their names”.

                He said that during conflicts, it was common for extended families to take care of children who lost their parents.</p>
    <p>Now, it believes that “almost all children are in need” of such help. “That’s more than one million children,” Crickx said.

        According to the Palestinian health ministry, Israeli attacks have killed more than 27,100 people in Gaza since the war began on October 7, around 11,500 of them children.
        
        More than 66,200 others have been wounded amid a severe lack of medical supplies and functioning healthcare facilities. Thousands more are missing and are under the rubble.
        
        </p>
        <p>With Israeli ground troops encircling most of northern, central, and eastern Gaza, families have been forced to flee their homes several times since the war began. Many are now crammed in the southern Rafah governorate, which Israel has said is its next target of attack.

            Many who fled their homes have been shot at and arrested. Those who make it to the south often have no contact with their relatives or caregivers in other parts of the enclave, especially during times of communication blackouts.
            
            “Children don’t have anything to do with this conflict. Yet they are suffering like no child should ever suffer,” said Crickx.</p>

                Six months into the war on Gaza, over 10,000 women have been killed, among them an estimated 6,000 mothers, leaving 19,000 children orphaned.
              </h1>
              <p>New York/Cairo — Today, UN Women launches its latest Gender Alert on Gaza. Six months into the war, 10,000 Palestinian women in Gaza have been killed, among them an estimated 6,000 mothers, leaving 19,000 children orphaned. Women who have survived Israeli bombardment and ground operations have been displaced, widowed, and facing starvation. This devastating differentiated impact continues to make the war on Gaza also a war on women..</p>
               <p>The series of gender alerts produced by UN Women on Gaza provides a detailed analysis of the reality of women’s and girls’ lives in the Gaza Strip, documenting abhorrent living conditions. The publication launched today titled, Scarcity and Fear, focuses on the lack of access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, which are vital to women's health, dignity, safety, and privacy.</p>
         <p>More than one million Palestinian women and girls in Gaza are facing catastrophic hunger, with almost no access to food, safe drinking water, functioning toilets or running water, creating life-threatening risks. Access to clean water is especially critical for breastfeeding mothers and pregnant women, who have higher daily water and caloric intake requirements. It is also essential for the ability of women and girls to manage their menstrual hygiene with dignity and safety. UN Women estimates that 10 million disposable menstrual pads or four million reusable sanitary pads are required each month to cover the needs of 690,000 women and girls in Gaza.</p>
